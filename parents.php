                				<p id="q1" class="collapse">Parents, families, and new students are welcome to drop by the <i>McGill Parents Association’s Parents Tent</i> on lower campus, just inside the Roddick Gates, at the intersection of Sherbrooke Street West and McGill College Avenue. The Parents Tent is open from 9am-4pm from Aug 23-25 and 9am-3pm on Aug 26. Take advantage of activities such as library tours, info sessions, simulations of university classes and more! Visit the <a href="http://aoc.mcgill.ca/network/parents-association/dates-events/parents-tent">Parents Association’s website</a> for more info.</p>

                				<p id="q2" class="collapse"><i>Parent/Family Information Sessions</i> are organized by Campus Life &amp; Engagement and will discuss topics of interest to parents and address parent concerns in an informal setting.  You will learn about the support services that exist for McGill students and get tips on how your role from home can help us support our students.  These sessions will be followed by the <i>ABCs of Money Management /Facts about Fees!</i> session. For more information and to register for either or both sessions, visit the <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/firstyear/parents">Campus Life &amp; Engagement website.</a></p>

                				<p id="q3" class="collapse">All Orientation Week activities, except for Parent/Family Information Sessions, are for new McGill student participants only.</p>
                			</li>
                            <li>
                            	<p><a class="toggler" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q4">Is there anything that parents can do in the city while students are participating in Orientation/Frosh events?</a></p>
                				<p id="q4" class="collapse">Montreal is one of North America’s most cosmopolitan, dynamic and multicultural cities. It combines all the amenities of a large modern city with a rich history and diverse landscape, and provides a host of exciting cultural opportunities to explore. Why not take the opportunity to discover what Montreal has to offer before you head back home? <a href="http://www.tourisme-montreal.org/">Tourism Montreal</a> is a great resource to help plan an itinerary during your stay. McGill also has its own <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/redpath/">museum</a> on campus containing exhibits on popular specimens including dinosaurs, shells, mummies and a wide variety of Quebec minerals.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            	<p><a class="toggler" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q5">Are Orientation Week and Frosh just a week-long party?</a></p>
                				<p id="q5" class="collapse">While there are social elements to many activities and events during Orientation Week, this is also a valuable time for new students to learn about important services and resources at McGill, as well as prepare for the semester and their academic and extracurricular success. In particular, Campus Life &amp; Engagement’s Discover McGill: Academic Expectations workshops are available during Orientation Week to help students start off their semester on the right foot. Discover McGill day will also include time dedicated to having new students learn about on-campus resources as well as get oriented within their particular faculty.</p>

                            	<p><a class="toggler" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q6">What else should my child do during Orientation Week to prepare for the semester?</a></p>
                                <p id="q6" class="collapse">Apart from the fun, social activities, Orientation Week is a great opportunity to get organized for the semester. Getting a <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/students/records/id/">student ID</a> is top on the list. Also, you may want to work on getting a Canadian cell phone number and bank account for your child. The <a href="http://aoc.mcgill.ca/network/parents-association/dates-events/parents-tent">Parents Tent</a> is prepared to guide you in the right direction, or you can visit Campus Life &amp; Engagement’s <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/firstyear/montrealessentials">First-Year Essentials</a> page for more information. Although most booklists are given out at the first day of class, you may want to stock up on stationery and McGill gear by heading to the <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/bookstore">McGill Bookstore</a>, located on McTavish St. </p>
                            </li>

                            	<p><a class="toggler" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q7">What is Frosh?</a></p>
                                <p id="q7" class="collapse">Part of Orientation Week, Frosh is a student-run, multi-day event coordinated by a club, group, or Faculty student association and is primarily comprised of social activities. Faculty Froshes group students by faculty/school while Non-Faculty Froshes are available to all new McGill students and are based more on specific interests or religious backgrounds. Frosh is part of the larger Orientation Week, which is the 9-day period encompassing all the different events for incoming students hosted by a number of groups.</p>
                            </li>
                			<li>
                            	<p><a class="toggler" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q8">Will Frosh be supervised?</a></p>
                				<p id="q8" class="collapse">During Frosh, students are grouped with and accompanied by Frosh Leaders (upper-year students) who are thoroughly trained to promote, above all, a safe environment for participants. All students will be given the contact information for their Frosh Leaders, and students are encouraged to contact them when needed. In addition to Frosh Leaders, Frosh Coordinators (student organizers) are on hand and clearly identifiable to ensure the smooth running of the event.</p>
                            </li>
                			<li>
                            	<p><a class="toggler" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q9">What is included in the Frosh price? Shouldn’t students under 18 pay less?</a></p>
                				<p id="q9" class="collapse">Almost all other Orientation Week events besides Frosh are free. The Frosh price gains students a Frosh bracelet which gives them access to transportation, entrance to venues and large-scale events, food and beverages, Frosh bag with swag, and much more, including week-long communications and harm reduction team support.<br>Alcohol is provided at a cost on campus and factors in minimally into the Frosh price. For this and other reasons, students of any age are asked to pay the same price. In fact, the increased costs associated with organizing and ensuring the availability of Frosh events that students of all ages can attend would mean that technically students under 18 “cost" the Frosh organizing teams more than those over 18.<br>Students can pay and register online or in-person (cash only!) when they collect their Frosh goodie bag.</p>

                            	<p><a class="toggler" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q10">Can my child get their Frosh payment reimbursed?</a></p>
                				<p id="q10" class="collapse">If your child would like to unregister for an event they have already paid for via PayPal, they will need to contact the event coordinators for that event. In the event they decide not to participate in Frosh after they have paid, we advise them to check online for the refund deadline for the Frosh they have signed up for. If it is past this deadline, they will most likely be unable to receive a refund. Refunds are rarely given once Frosh has begun unless it is for extenuating circumstances.</p>
                            </li>
                			<li>
                            	<p><a class="toggler" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q11">Can my child just register and pay for certain Frosh events?</a></p>
                				<p id="q11" class="collapse">Unfortunately we cannot logistically offer à la carte pricing or registration to any events during Frosh, save for the <a href="http://msamcgill.wix.com/frosh">MSA Frosh</a>.</p>
                            </li>
                			<li>
                            	<p><a class="toggler" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q12">What are the rules about alcohol during Frosh?</a></p>
                				<p id="q12" class="collapse">Alcohol will be available at select Frosh events and will be available only for students who are above the age of 18, the legal drinking age in Quebec. However, Frosh Leaders are well-equipped to accommodate students who do not wish to consume alcohol (regardless of age), and an overconsumption of alcohol is not encouraged. Also, all servers of alcohol on campus have been trained prior to Frosh, being granted the responsibility to serve alcohol by a university education program (<a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/firstyear/leadertraining/server">Server Training</a>).<br>Students under the age of 18 should not feel that their age will hinder their Frosh experience. There will be many activities for them to participate in and that will give them an opportunity to meet other students and make new friends. If your child drinks when they are underage, it can have consequences (legal and otherwise), not only for them, but for the entirety of Frosh.</p>
                            </li>
                			<li>
                            	<p><a class="toggler" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q13">What do you need to bring during Frosh?</a></p>
                				<p id="q13" class="collapse">Although food and beverages are provided, students are encouraged to fill their Frosh bag with snacks and a water bottle, as well as sunscreen, identification, health insurance information, and a pen and paper or phone to record new contacts they may meet during the week. Students should also bring along some cash to pay for any additional items they may want to purchase. Don’t forget to pack any necessary medical supplies such as allergy medication!</p>
                            </li>

                            	<p><a class="toggler" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q14">My child does not like his/her Frosh group. Can it be changed?</a></p>
                				<p id="q14" class="collapse">We want Frosh to be a great experience for all students! Feel free to encourage your child to speak to a Frosh Coordinator about the situation, and he/she will do his/her best to accommodate your child. </p>
                            </li>
                			<li>
                            	<p><a class="toggler" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q15">I am concerned about safety during Frosh events.</a></p>
                                <p id="q15" class="collapse">In order to ensure safety during Frosh events and throughout the year, a number of services are available for the McGill community.<br>The McGill Student Emergency Response Team is present during Frosh and any public event at McGill. In addition, McGill Security Services patrols both campuses 24 hours a day and the downtown campus has a network of emergency phones located along walkways and other locations.<br>Volunteer members of the student-run <a href="http://walksafe.ca/">Walksafe</a> program are available to escort anyone home, anywhere on the island of Montreal. The free <a href="http://ssmu.mcgill.ca/drivesafe/">Drivesafe</a> program is available to take students home from campus events and during scheduled patrols.<br>Although Montreal is known as a relatively safe city, all normal safety precautions should be taken.</p>

                                <p id="q16" class="collapse">On our campus, all incoming residence students and Frosh participants are given condoms upon arrival. These are provided by the <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/studenthealth/promotion">Student Health Service</a> and ensure that relevant health materials are available to all students, regardless of their level of sexual activity.  Whether students choose to use these for their own needs or are able to help out a friend in need, accessibility to safer sex supplies encourages students to make healthier choices and encourages well-being.</p>

                                <p id="q17" class="collapse">Feeling overwhelmed? The <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/firstyear">Campus Life &amp; Engagement</a> office is the place to go when you do not know where to turn to. Find us on 3600 McTavish St. in suite 3100. However, do not hesitate to ask around for help. Visit the Orientation Week information kiosk or other kiosks on lower campus and our McGill staff and student volunteers should be able to answer your questions or direct you to our office.</p>

                                <p id="q18" class="collapse">Depending on the nature of the concern, it is likely best to contact the Orientation Week team at <a href="mailto:orientation@ssmu.mcgill.ca">orientation@ssmu.mcgill.ca</a>. Serious concerns about student behaviour can be directed to the Dean of Students, André Costopoulos, at <a href="mailto:andre.costopoulos@mcgill.ca">andre.costopoulos@mcgill.ca</a>. Above all, however, we encourage you, where possible, to have your child initiate the communication. We may be legally unable to provide you with certain information if your child is of the age of majority and/or has not given their express consent.</p>
