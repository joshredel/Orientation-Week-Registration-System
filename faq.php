It is an excellent opportunity for new students to get to know the University, the city of Montreal, other peers in their Faculty, and upper-year students. </p>

It’s when you’ll get vital information about filling up your semesters with classes, co-curricular activities, and leisure time. Plus, there is no better time to meet people, from support staff, fellow first-years, and upper-year students, through fun and interactive events. The memories you make and people you meet during the week will create a great start to your McGill career. </p>

                                <p id="q21" class="collapse">The Orientation Week events and programming listed in this website are for all new undergraduate students at McGill University. New students includes students entering their first year of university at McGill, transfer students new to McGill, and exchange students new to McGill. Returning students, family members, and friends of new students that are not also attending McGill for the first time are not permitted to attend Orientation Week events.<br>
                                New graduate students to McGill University should visit Campus Life &amp; Engagement's <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/firstyear/grad-students/fall-orientation">Grad Student Orientation</a> page for more information.</p>

                                <p id="q3" class="collapse">Depending on what you choose to do, participation in Orientation Week can cost as little as completely free. Most individual events are free or have minimal costs for equipment rentals. There is also a cost associated with participating in any Frosh, which covers costs such as admission fees and food. You can click on the WHAT'S INCLUDED button in the Frosh category of the <a href="./events.php">Events</a> page for a more complete list of what the cost covers.<br>
                                Alcohol is provided at a cost on campus and factors in minimally into the Frosh price. For this and other reasons, students of any age are asked to pay the same price. In fact, the increased costs associated with organizing and ensuring the availability of Frosh events that students of all ages can attend would mean that technically students under 18 “cost” the Frosh organizing teams more than those over 18.</p>

Also, many of the larger activities during Faculty Frosh are done with other faculties, so you will still get the opportunity to meet other new students outside your faculty.
